# RMM-research

This repository has all the workings of the Primitive research for Replicating Market Makers. This work is primarily managed by Primitives Head of Research [0xEstelle](https://github.com/0xEstelle), and [0xJepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen). Because we believe in public open source work, we intend to upload all work to this repository.

## Simulations

Most of this work will be python simulations for product performance and analysis. Each project will have its own directory with its affiliated simulations. We will also publish finished work for these projects in their directories.
