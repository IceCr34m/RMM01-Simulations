# RMM-research

This repository has all the workings of the Primitive research for Replicating Market Makers. This work is primarily managed by Primitives Head of Research [0xEstelle](https://github.com/0xEstelle), and [0xJepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen). Because we believe in public open source work, we intend to upload all work to this repository. Please use this repository for the most up to date versions of our work.

## Whitepaper 

   Constant function market makers (CFMMs) have evolved from a small group of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to a broad and largely undiscovered class of automated market makers (AMMs). CFMMs are decentralized exchanges fully backed by a community of liquidity providers seeking to earn a yield on their deposited assets. The portfolio of a liquidity provider follows a payoff structure specific to the CFMM they are providing liquidity too. It was recently shown that the space of concave, non-negative, non-decreasing, 1-homogeneous payoff functions and the space of convex CFMMs are equivalent, along with a method to convert between a given payoff of the above type with an associated CFMM. These CFMMs, which replicate specific, desired payoff functions, are called replicating market makers (RMMs). In this paper, we present an implementation of an RMM that approximates a Black--Scholes covered call, which we call RMM-01.

## Simulations

Most of this work will be python simulations for product performance and analysis. Each project will have its own directory with its affiliated simulations. We will also publish finished work for these projects in their directories.
